2. Build and run the project

```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/oop-registration-example-fat.jar
```

## Results

After successful registration, you will find four new files in the project directory.

| Filename                                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                             |

| client.crt                                  | This is your client certificate, emulating QWAC. Present this any time you want to establish a mutually authenticated TLS connection.                                                   |
| key.pem                                     | Private key corresponding to the certificate in client.crt. Used for encrypting traffic and must be used when establishing mutually authenticated TLS.                                  |
| OP-TEST-TPP-\<generated-tpp-id\>-client.p12 | P12 keystore. Password and passphrase will be "test" unless you modify the code to change them. **Store the tpp id** as it is needed with authorization requests.                       |
| ssa-signing-key.pem                         | Your private key for signing JWTs, emulating QSEALC. Used for signing the SSA and registration JWT, but ALSO used for signing authorization request JWTs. Use ES256 asymmetric signing. |
| registration-result.txt                     | Details of the registration. This file will contain e.g. client_id, client_secret, ssaSigningKid, and all other information related to your client app.                                 |
